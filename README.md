# Type3D
3D Graphics Library built with TypeScript

## Overview
Type3D aims to be a simple and efficient 3D Graphics Library, implemented in TypeScript for fast prototyping and customization of 3D math and game development toolkits.

## Build
If you do not have them already, install [Visual Studio Community or higher](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx) and [Typescript Tools with Standalone Compiler](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3e5ba71c-abea-4d00-b81b-a62de3ad3d53). Then, clone the repository into Visual Studio 2015, build the solution, and start experimenting right away with the example projects. If you are unable to build the project, verify that you have <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript\1.5</code> in your system path environment variable and that you can run <code>tsc<code> from the command prompt.

## Design
Type3D providing both the novice and professional developer with a solid framework that leverages TypeScript features, such as namespaces, interfaces, classes, generics, build-time type checking, and powerful intellisense integration. These tools facilitate rapid design and prototyping, console-integrated testing and debugging, and fast code refactoring for any custom 3D graphics engine for TypeScript/JavaScript.
